    Add new C++ programs for various algorithms and data processing tasks
    
    - Implemented a string reduction algorithm in `abcd.cpp` to remove specific character pairs.
    - Created a prime counting and factorial arrangement program in `arrangeprime.cpp`.
    - Developed basic arithmetic operations in `arthameticoperatiors.cpp`.
    - Added a linear search implementation in `linear.cpp`.
    - Implemented mean, median, and mode calculations in `meanmedianmode.cpp`.
    - Created a program to calculate combinations (nCr) in `ncrbasic.cpp`.
    - Developed a GCD-based string division check in `stringgcd.cpp`.
    - Implemented a unique element finder in `unique.cpp`.
    
    All files are newly created and contain complete implementations with input/output functionality.

    Add new C++ programs for various algorithms and data processing tasks
    
    - Implemented a program in `ab and x.cpp` to check if the absolute difference between two numbers is divisible by a third number.
    - Created a bit-checking program in `checkbit.cpp` to determine if a specific bit is set in an integer.
    - Developed a program in `maxele.cpp` to find the maximum element in an array.
    - Added a program in `mergesortedarr.cpp` to merge two sorted arrays and print the result.
    - Implemented a digit-minimization algorithm in `mindigit.cpp` to reduce a number to its smallest digit.
    - Created a program in `minsub.cpp` to find the minimum difference between a power of two and a given number.
    - Developed a program in `missingnumber.cpp` to find the missing number in a sequence from 1 to 100.
    - Added a number distribution program in `numdistribution.cpp` to count zeros, positives, and negatives in an array.
    - Implemented a partition-checking algorithm in `threepart.cpp` to determine if an array can be split into three equal sum parts.
    
    All files are newly created and contain complete implementations with input/output functionality.
